                <br>
                <p><b>Reporting Security Issues and Concerns</b></p>
                <p>To report a security incident or to submit a vulnerability report for a PETTATO service. To file an abuse report for any PETTATO service or a PETTATO owned domain or IP address space. To file an authority request, support@pettato.com.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Vulnerability Research and Incident Reporting</b></p>
                <p>PETTATO recognizes and supports responsible vulnerability research and disclosure. While we encourage responsible vulnerability research and incident reporting, attempt to exploit a vulnerability with malicious intent is an unlawful action and is subject to legal prosecution by law enforcement agencies. Vulnerability research should not impact normal service activity. Extraction of data beyond minimum required to demonstrate a vulnerability (e.g. database version and one table structure), or testing of DoS (Denial of Service) scenarios are prohibited and will be considered as malicious activity. Performing research activities should not involve automated tools and utilities. All tests should be executed using researchers own accounts if applicable with no impact to other service users.</p>
                <p><b>Responsible Disclosure</b></p>
                <p>Vulnerability reports should include detailed technical description of the vulnerability and steps required to reproduce erroneous behavior in plain text. Screenshots (jpeg/png) and traffic dumps are accepted as additional information. Vulnerability reports should not include links to external resources or malicious code designed to compromise data of a person verifying the vulnerability.</p>
                <p><b>Public Disclosure</b></p>
                <p>As part of coordinated disclosure, public disclosure is allowed 90 days after PETTATO acknowledges acceptance of the report or after the bug is fixed and verified by the reporter. Exception to this 90-day rule are issues where proper fix is by no means possible for PETTATO or where PETTATO and the researcher agree on longer response time. Public disclosure may include only technical information regarding vulnerability. Any additional information that is not required for understanding the vulnerability should be excluded out of public disclosure.</p>
                <p><b>Reporting Abuse</b></p>
                <p>Abuse reports and objectionable content reports will be acted upon within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who is providing the offending content. Information should include the origin of malicious traffic in the case that the abuse report is filed for PETTATO domains or address spaces, or link to content if the abusive content is published somewhere within PETTATO services. If the access to abusive content is limited and requires specific actions to be executed â€“ steps to reproduce access to the abusive content should be included in the report.</p>
                <p><b>Authority Requests</b></p>
                <p>Law enforcement officials seeking information from PETTATO services, should file an official request. Authority request should describe the cause of request, name of issuing law enforcement organization, identification (badge number or ID) of the law enforcement agent in charge of the request and direct contact phone number. The request should be coming from a law-enforcement domain. The request should have a precise description of what type of information is requested since the PETTATO organization is unable to process broad or vague requests.</p>
