                Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.
                We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. By building systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience here, based on things you and others do on and off PETTATO.
                Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.
                We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with law enforcement.
